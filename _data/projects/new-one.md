### The original design

The Turu 21 office building (henceforth referred to as “The original design”) was designed by Kadarik Tüür Archi- tects on **Turu** street 21 in Tartu Estonia, but has never been built.

The building was to have 5 storeys. The ground floor was meant for commercial activities, the 4 floors above it would have been offices. Parking was placed underneath the building and there would have been a rooftop terrace for the inhabitants.

The structural body of the building consists of reinforced concrete posts and reinforced concrete slabs. The three facades of the building were covered in precast concrete panels. The front facade was intended to be glazed.
