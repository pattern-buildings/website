The skin is the layer protecting the [body](/docs/body/) of the Pattern Building from outside, consisting offacade and roof elements. The skin is the most obvious tool for mass customisation of the Pattern Building as it allows the same body to have very different appearances. The facade and the roof of the building can be installed on site and therefore it is important to consider their transport already in the early design phase.

The skin of the building is attached to the body of the building in the form of panelised elements; in the case of external structures, the facade elements and the factory-produced wall with interior finishing are joined together.
