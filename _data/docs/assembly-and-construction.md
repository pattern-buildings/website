Before starting the installation of the modules, it is mandatory to check the existence and validity of **documentation, approvals and quality** and **safety certificates**. 

The design and construction of the foundation requires the provision and installation of module anchorage elements according to the project. A tolerance of **+/-7 mm** is allowed for the difference in the height of anchoring points. When the foundation is set up, all junctions will be installed for utility water, sewerage and electricity according to the project. When installing modules, it is necessary to check that all junctions are accessible and that the utility systems of each module are connected to the following one before the new module is installed.

When planning access to the construction site, one must consider the lifting height of the modules, the surface of the access, cable lines and vegetation. Access roads must have sufficient turning and lifting radiuses.

Modules must be lifted according to the lifting schemes and safety instructions. Lifting schemes are module-based. Before starting lifting operations, the persons carrying out these works must be instructed and equipped with type-specific lifting schemes. The speed and safety of the installation depends strictly on the location of the crane as well as on the planning of the vehicle access sequence, so it is recommended to make simulations with different scenarios before the final plan is carried out.

The site work plan must take into account the different weights of the different modules between **6 t** and **25 t**. The module weight must be reflected in its name and on its packaging (for example, *M6-3_4*, *8T_S*).

The protective packaging of the modules is environmentally friendly and reusable. When removing the protective packaging, it is made sure that the module is in good condition; that the seals and insulation material on the side of the module are intact and properly installed. The packaging is sent back to the factory with the pallets.

The accuracy of the installation of the modules shall be ensured by conical twist-lock connectors. No lifting work shall be carried out during the fixing works and other interconnection works between the floors. During the assembly of the modules, all lifting and connecting metal components shall be insulated with temperature, water and fire resistant materials according to the instructions. During the installation, control measurements shall be carried out after each floor installation and, if necessary, specific leveling plates for height adjustment shall be used.

The installation of facade elements shall be carried out according to the unique design of each object. In order to save time on the site, the facade elements may be partially installed in the factory. In this case, the modules have indications about the facade element and extra caution is needed when lifting as not to damage the facade cover materials or openings. When installing roof elements, the rainwater drainage project must be followed and it must be ensured that the internal drainage pipes are installed in the right order according to the plan. The humidity control manual must be followed during the installation of the modules and the modules must be protected against precipitation during working breaks.

All external structures of the modular system are added after installation of the modules and delivery of the installation works.
