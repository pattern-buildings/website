To reduce the spread of noise from one functional unit of the Pattern Building (e.g. an apartment) to another, it is recommended not to design different units in the same module. In other words, each unit should consist only of separate room modules.

The spread of airborne sound noise between functional units is prevented by double partitions and dropped ceilings. To prevent impact sound noise, the floor board is separated from the end frame by an elastic noise barrier profile, preventing the sound from being transferred to the moduleâ€™s frame posts. As an additional measure, a noise-cancelling interlayer is installed on the ceiling of the module, preventing the transmission of sound from the floor of the upper module.
