title: Heating and cooling
order: 11

There are two basic options for heating the house: water heating and electric heating.

Water heating uses convectors on the walls or below the ceiling. The water heating is either part of the central heating or works on an autonomous boiler.

Floor heating works with electricity.

Cooling should be passive and achieved by design, orientation, placement and shielding of the buildingâ€™s openings. In case of water heating, it is also possible to use the ceiling panels as cooling elements.
