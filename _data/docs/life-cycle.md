The eco-friendliness of the house is ensured by modern methods of construction and factory-based production that make the Pattern Building energy efficient. 

The load bearing structures and main structures of the house are largely made of wood. As trees grow, the carbon contained in the atmosphere is captured and sequestered in the wooden building for a long period of time. If the construction of wood is to be sustainable, the life expectancy of the main structures of wood buildings in northern Europe should be expected to be **at least 80 years**, in other words at least as long as the wood used in the construction would be growing in nature.

Thus, the designed life span of Pattern Buildings shall be **at least 100 years**. The essential conditions for achieving this are the insulation of wooden elements from the ground; proper melting snow water and rainwater treatment; flexibility in changing the spatial layout and straightforward approach to repairing or changing building components. Each Pattern Building should come with a manual ... which sets out the principles for the maintenance.
