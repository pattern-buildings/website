The electricity cabling runs along the bottom edge of the walls in the in-wall cable channel, allowing to change the position of the plugs and switches according to the layout of the rooms.

The horizontal lines are hidden in the cable trays installed behind the floor plates and between the floor beams. The vertical lines are behind the finishing board or, if necessary, vertically installed in the adjustable cable box. The lighting switches are wireless.
