One of the main principles of the Pattern Building is environment-friendly approach, which means, among other things, that the active energy consumption of the building is (very) low (at a minimum level of nearly zero-energy building) and that the buildingâ€™s structures are long-lasting. This can be achieved by ensuring good insulation appropriate to the local climate and long-term air-insulating building envelope. 

The envelope of the building is made up of the skin and the skeleton. The vapour and air-insulating layer must be continuous along the whole building envelope. While the skin of the building is airtight, the skeleton of the Pattern Building seals the gap between modules. This solution makes the Pattern Building mass-adjustable because the air-tight layer is uninterrupted regardless of the shape or appearance of the building.

The Pattern Building is adaptable to different climate zones. Depending on the climate zone, the thickness of the insulation layer required to ensure good thermal insulation varies. The thickness of the insulation layer of the building can be adjusted with the thickness of the skin. This means that the Pattern Building with the same body can theoretically be built in all regions in Europe, with changes only in facade elements.
