In accordance with the manual [_“Standard solutions for building up to eight-storey wooden buildings”_](https://www.rescue.ee/files/2018-09/standardlahendused-kuni-kaheksakorruseliste-puithoonete-ehitamiseks.pdf?69a2bddc66) by A. Just et al _(in Estonian)_, the Pattern Building’s Portable Structure classifies as the **post-beam system**. Load bearing posts and beams made of laminated timber or _LVL_ are protected from fire. Exposed _LVL_ elements are designed with a cross-section that allows them to stay in the fire for a considerable period of time without requiring additional fire protection. The fire safety of the facade is ensured by a building-specific project. Automatic fire fighting system must be designed in five-storey and higher buildings. Automatic fire extinguishing system must be installed in the stairway that has reaction to fire of _D-s2,d2_, in case there are more than two floors in the building.
