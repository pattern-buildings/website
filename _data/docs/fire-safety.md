In accordance with the manual *“Standard solutions for building up to eight-storey wooden buildings”* by A. Just et al (LINK), the Pattern Building’s Portable Structure classifies as the **post-beam system**. Load bearing posts and beams made of laminated timber or *LVL* are protected from fire. Exposed *LVL* elements are designed with a cross-section that allows them to stay in the fire for a considerable period of time without requiring additional fire protection. The fire safety of the facade is ensured by a building-specific project. Automatic fire fighting system must be designed in five-storey and higher buildings. Automatic fire extinguishing system must be installed in the stairway that has reaction to fire of *D-s2,d2*, in case there are more than two floors in the building.
