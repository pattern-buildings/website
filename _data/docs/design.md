The design process is a significant hindrance in the overall off-site construction process as it seizes up to three quarters of the total production time. Predesigned modules help to significantly reduce the design time. The Pattern Building system provides architects with tools to design various functional layouts and spatial aesthetics, while having the overall structure and technical junctions already standardised and resolved. By using pre-designed modules, it is also possible to accurately pre-calculate the bill of materials, estimate various cost aspects and other quantitative data necessary for the production and construction of the building. 

The Pattern Building system provides an opportunity to easily try out different spatial scenarios and assess their suitability from a functional, financial and aesthetical perspective. In addition to standardised modules, Pattern Building can feature custom designed parts such as basement, entrances, atriums, etc. Pattern Building is a customised solution by its nature, allowing sensitivity to context and flexibility in the creation of buildings with varied character.
