The structural components of room modules once connected together, form the skeleton. The skeleton supports the body and the skin of Pattern Building. The skeleton also includes shear walls and other constructive elements external to the standard room modules, e.g. vertical stair cores and elevator shafts.

Room modules are connected to one another on-site. The ceiling elements are connected with a steel plate forming a diaphragm, through which the horizontal loads are applied to the share walls. The share walls are enclosed in spaces between the modules and should be placed in accordance with the following requirements:

* There must be at least four share walls, two in each grid axis of the building;
* Rigid walls running on parallel axles do not need to be side-by-side;
* The distance between parallel rigid walls must not exceed 9 m
* The minimum thickness of the share wall is 100mm and the length in plan is 3 m
