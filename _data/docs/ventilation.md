The Pattern Building concept does not directly require the use of specific ventilation units, but there are three possible design solutions:

**Autonomous system**. The ventilation system is serviced by the exhaust air heat pump, which also solves heating and domestic water. The diameter of the pipes is 125 mm. The inlet and outlet pipes are isolated.

**Element system**. Ventilation is placed in pre-manufactured modular elements with water and electricity channels (e.g. Silotek) and is located above a dropped ceiling. The diameter of the pipes is 200, 160 and 125 mm.

**Open system**. In the case of an open system, the pipes are visible beneath the ceiling. Pipe dimensions are 315, 200, 160 and 125 mm. The channels are painted.

In the Element system, ventilation is installed as integrated panels of the dropped ceiling.
