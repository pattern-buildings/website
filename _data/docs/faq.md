> **Why is it better than other industrial construction systems?**

For a start, Pattern Buildings are to a large extent made of timber products, and timber is good for reducing CO2 emissions of the construction sector. 

Compared to other timber-based systems, it is also quite flexible in terms of type of designs that it can produce. The system is engineered to truly enable mass-customisation. While the production of building components can potentially be highly automated, the design of pattern builings can be personalised to suite the user's needs and localised to the environmental and cultural context. 

One technical thing that is exceptional in the system is it's capacity to build modular structures that are airtight by nature. In a typical 3D volumetric / modular construction, all modules are sealed from the boundary of each unit separately. This makes it difficult to seal the building envelope because there are so many connections to be taped / sealed. Our system does it by joining the corner posts of modules into a single airtight column. Good airtightness, as you probably know, leads to less energy consumption (ie smaller bills) and thus more environment friendly houses

And finally, Pattern Building is an open source system, unlike many systems that are merging in the construction industry. 

> **Why is the LVL chosen as the main structural material?**

Because its strength , lightness, look & feel, manufacturability.

Potentially. But we have not designed or calculated it. You are welcome to redesign the system or parts of it. Or you can ask the authors of the system to add the feature.
