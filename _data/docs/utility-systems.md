The Pattern Building’s utility systems ensure the day-to-day operation of the building. The utility systems are divided as follows: ventilation, heating and cooling, water and sewerage, electricity, automation.

The indoor climate quality of the building is achieved with an energy efficient ventilation system combined with heat recovery. The rate of heat recovery depends on the specific type of building and its location. The heat recovery rate should generally not be less than 80% and the specific fan power (SFP) should ideally be around 1.5 kW m Ñ/s.

In order to reduce the pressure loss in the pipes and the resulting additional energy consumption, the layout of the rooms should favour the use of relatively short and straight pipes. In the case of apartments, the minimum diameter of the pipes under the ceiling of the room module would be 125 mm (with a silencer 160 mm), in public buildings up to 600 mm.

All utility systems can be connected vertically in the cavity between the modules.
