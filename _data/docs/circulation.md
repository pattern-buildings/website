Circulation is a functional part of the Pattern Building, which includes the buildingâ€™s stairways, lifts, corridors and other access points. Circulation is a system that makes all parts of the Pattern Building accessible for the user. 

Stairwells and corridors can, as a rule, be placed in 3 by 3 grid and solved as standard modules. Lift  shafts are parts of circulation but are not modular as a rule and can be used as rigid elements to support the skeleton.

Generally, all parts of the circulation have been designed separately from other parts of the body to improve sound insulation and ensure that the solution complies with the core design requirement of Autonomy.
