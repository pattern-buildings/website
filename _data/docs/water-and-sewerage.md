Since the beams on the longer side of the module are moved towards the centre of the module, there is a **dedicated space** for drain stacks between the two modules with a width of **350 mm**.

In the case of sewerage and water systems, pipes should be as short as possible. In the case of sewerage, it is very important not to design the toilet in such a way that a large diameter pipe should move through the corners of the modules in order to reach the soil stack. In other words, **large sewage pipes must remain within the limits of one module**.
