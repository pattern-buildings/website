The base of the building is the lowest part of the building in contact with the ground. It supports the [body](/docs/body/) of wooden modules built on top.  

The base can be a foundation, a landing, a basement or a ground floor, for example. The base of the building is designed according to the shape of the building, the plot and the purpose of the building. The base must wear the weight of the building’s body and support the corners of the first floor’s room modules.
