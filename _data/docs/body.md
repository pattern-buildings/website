The body of Pattern Building is the architectural volume of the building, made up of [room modules](/docs/room-module/) complete with internal finishes. The body is designed for a 3Ã—3m grid and consists of modules of different sizes denoted as **M3**, **M6** and **M9**.

The body of the building is covered with facade and roof elements, here referred to as the [skin](/docs/skin/).

Since the actual size of the modules is unyieldingly accurate in terms of designing volumes, a planar grid with dimensions of **3 m by 3 m** should be used. When placing modules in the building's [skeleton](/docs/skeleton/), the general rule is that all modules follow the layout grid.

All modules have **31 mm** space in every direction to fit fastenings and insulation materials.
