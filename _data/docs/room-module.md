The key part of the building is the factory-produced room module. The module is designed for up to seven floor buildings and withstands the dynamic loads applied on transport and installation.

The module is composed of four corner columns, a ceiling element and a floor element made of laminated veneer lumber or LVL, and metal corner fittings that provide the structural stability.

Interior walls, finishing layers and equipment for utility systems can all be added to the room module at the factory. If transport restrictions permit, facade elements are also added to the perimeter modules.

The modules are produced in three nominal sizes: 3X3m (M3), 3X6 m (M6) and 3X9 m (M9), and two heights: 3.45 m and 3.13 m. It is important to distinguish the nominal dimensions from the actual dimensions of the modules, which are somewhat smaller.

The minimum internal dimensions of the modules are shown on the drawing above. The thickness of the finishing layers is further added to these dimensions.
